## Guidelines

### ActionBar

##### Use ActionBar only as a root to the Page element. In Angular, the Page element is hidden - use at root level.
##### Never Use ActionBar in custom component in Vanilla or shared component in Angular.

### ListView

##### Use RadListView when having a dynamic page listview. Use ListView when having a list of items (like links).
##### Use _itemTap_ event when handling selection in *RadListView* instead of _tap_ on the item template.

### Drawer

##### Use RadSideDrawer only as a root to the Page element. In Angular, the Page element is hidden - use at root level.
##### Never Use RadSideDrawer in custom component in Vanilla or shared component in Angular.
